# üî® Development

## Installation

This is for installation for Cumulus development.  See the [Cumulus deployment instructions](https://nasa.github.io/cumulus/docs/deployment/deployment-readme) for instructions on deploying the released Cumulus packages.

### Prerequisites

* [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and node version 8.
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
* BASH
* Docker (only required for testing)
* docker-compose (only required for testing `pip install docker-compose`)

Install the correct node version:

```
nvm install
nvm use
```

### Install Lerna

We use Lerna to manage multiple Cumulus packages in the same repo. You need to install lerna as a global module first:

    $ yarn global add lerna

### Install Local Dependencies

We use yarn for local package management

    $ yarn install
    $ yarn ybootstrap

Building All packages:

    $ yarn build

Build and watch packages:

    $ yarn watch

## üìù Tests

### Unit Tests

#### LocalStack

[LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) provides local versions of most AWS services for testing.

The LocalStack repository has [installation instructions](https://github.com/localstack/localstack#installing).

Localstack is included in the docker-compose file. You only need to run the docker-compose command in the next section in order to use it with your tests.

#### Docker containers

Turn on the docker containers first:

    $ docker-compose up local

If you prefer to run docker in detached mode (i.e. run containers in the background), run:

    $ docker-compose up -d local

#### Run tests

Run the test commands next

    $ export LOCALSTACK_HOST=localhost
    $ yarn test

### Integration Tests

For more information please [read this](docs/development/integration-tests.md).
